I finally decided to start blogging about my experiences and my day to day life as a final year undergrad student.

When I started my university I was being overwhelmed with just how many tasks I had to do every single day and then I fell down the productivity rabbit hole after watching Ali Abdaal's videos. He's a great teacher and youtuber and after watching his video on the concept of a second brain led me down more the personal knowledge management and knowledge management systems rabbit holes as well.

Then there are the people that sell Notion templates and courses and expect you to be a productivity powerhouse after you've paid them any where from $5 to all the way to $200 (God damn). Of course, I only bought the free ones and the ones that come with Notion itself.

I live in Pakistan, where there are internet outages and electricity is not available most of the time during the day so using Notion for everything had become more of a chore for me rather than being something I would enjoy using. I came across another note taking app called Obsidian (Which I use to write this blog as well) and it was almost perfect for me at the time when I found it.

I didn't need any internet to use it, it was more faster and responsive than Notion, and all of my data was in plain markdown files that I could open with any other app that I wanted to use and it was all stored on my local drive as well.

I saw Obsidian as a win-win situation for me. I could focus on my studies and learning without having to worry about anything else. (Except for my laptop's battery dying).

After almost four years of writing and learning with Obsidian I think it's time for me share my knowledge with the world and this blog is exactly where it will be available for everyone to access freely.
