November went by quickly for me. That's not something you would want to hear, right? I spent most of last month doing two things: either I was sick with a fever or a sore throat, or I was busy studying for tests or making assignments that my professors had assigned my class.

I tried my best to write about the things that I found interesting this month but couldn't spare the time. I completed the Forward program by McKinsey and Co. It was an online program, learned great things about the workplace and how to navigate my career to the right path early on.

I also finished my FYP and submitted the final deliverables. Thank God. That was a hectic job. I regretted taking on a custom project that I submitted myself because, at the time of submission, I was so sure of myself, and when I actually started to code, it was challenging, to say the least.

One achievement I would like to brag about is learning SQL in depth, thanks to DataCamp and their free weekend offer. Other than that, November was like a fever dream, literally.
