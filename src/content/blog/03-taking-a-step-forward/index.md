I recently got accepted into the McKinsey Forward program. This 10-week online program teaches individuals how to equip themselves with essential digital tools and prepares them for the rapid changes in our world.

In the first week of the program, I gained valuable insights into the transformative power of generative AI. It's clear that the world has become highly competitive and fast-paced, and failing to keep up with the latest advancements could render one obsolete in a matter of months.

The program emphasizes the importance of constantly acquiring new skills and staying abreast of industry trends as generative AI continues to drive innovation and automate a significant portion of our tasks.

The message is clear - individuals must cultivate resilience, embrace change, and focus on self-improvement. It's become the norm in society to learn how to leverage generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude AI.

Moreover, I had the opportunity to delve into three distinct case stories during the first week, which provided practical examples of how skills I will learn can be used in real-life scenarios. This exposure was invaluable in demonstrating the versatility of these skills across different contexts.

I also attended a welcoming webinar that outlined the goals and syllabus of the program, the welcome webinar was a nice introduction to the program and I also met few of my batch mates as well as some Alumni who shared their stories of how they worked on the course modules when they were in the program.

I'm excited for what's next in this journey and i'll be posting about it as I go forward with it (pun intended).
