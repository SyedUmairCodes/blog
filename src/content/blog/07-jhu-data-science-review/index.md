My review of the first course in the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The course provides a shallow and over-the-top overview of data science and its types. It goes into introducing the R programming language and helps the student set it up but doesn't teach R at all. Adding a few lessons about the basics would've made a huge difference since the student will know what R is but doesn't know how to use it. The same goes for Git and GitHub, although you learn some basics about them in the final project. The relational data model module also doesn't teach much about the basics of databases that much and just teaches what tables are.

The course lacks depth in material, a course that is listed as 17 hours long the content itself is 2-3 hours long if you pay attention and lock in. It makes the course unnecessary because you don't need it if you aren't going to learn anything and only spend a few hours setting up tools on your computer, which the target audience already knows how to.

With this, I'm skeptical about the rest of the specialization. Because the first course didn't meet my expectations and I'm not looking forward to being disappointed again by a course designed by such a wonderful educational institute.
