Hey friends! I’m excited to share what I got up to in October 2024 with all of you. It was quite a month, and I can’t wait to tell you about it!

## Research

Over the past month, I've realized that my note-taking and writing system is inadequate. It lacks organization, making it difficult to find specific notes, and the unclear structure leads to confusion about how ideas are connected. Frustratingly, there's no efficient way to quickly retrieve information when needed. This has motivated me to explore better tools and strategies to improve my productivity.

I began watching tutorials about [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) on YouTube, but most of them were too complex for me, so I decided to not follow them and create my approach instead. However, I find that Notion is quite slow even with a single database. I'm not sure why that is, but it might be due to the AI integrations that I got disabled for my workspace by contacting Notion support and it made things a bit faster.

I explored [Capacities](https://capacities.io/), which is similar to Notion but employs an object-based networked approach for storing notes. I found that Capacities is significantly faster than Notion and offers limited offline functionality. I was impressed by the platform, so I decided to use it as a backup for my permanent notes.

I discovered the Forever Notes framework from a [video by Tool Finder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vslX-NG_eGQ). Although the framework is designed for Apple Notes, I used it for a week but I'm not someone that can stick to a rigid structure for long so I only gave it a week.

In addition to note-taking, I explored an interesting concept known as luck surface area, which can help increase your luck. I plan to write more about this in a future blog post.

## Development and Code

This month, I completed three projects. While I know I could do more, I prefer to take my time to fully understand what I'm doing, rather than just following tutorials or blog posts without questioning them. One of the projects I worked on was a website for a blockchain-based startup, which I created for my portfolio. You can [learn more about it here.](https://github.com/syedUmairCodes/blockforge)

I coded a link in bio website entirely from scratch using pure HTML and CSS no JavaScript or unnecessary frameworks. After setting it up, I dedicated an entire Saturday to creating a landing page for a fictional travel agency in Indonesia called HiLink Travels. You can check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SyedUmairCodes/hilink-travel) for it.

I started my blog this month, and the website you are currently reading is my blog—unless someone else has copied and pasted this post onto their site. I created my blog using Astro.js, which allows me to use plain markdown files that serve as blog pages.

## Academia

This month, I spent most of my time focusing on my studies. I began the final semester of my computer science graduate program and was primarily occupied with assignments and quizzes. I also had to attend lectures at 7 in the morning, even though I study remotely, as attendance is mandatory.

I studied algorithms and data structures, revised cloud computing, and data engineering topics this month using books and online courses from Coursera.

I developed a learning plan for the GitHub Foundations exam, but I didn't have the time to follow through with it. Additionally, I enrolled in the McKinsey and Company Forward program, which prepares interns and junior professionals for their roles and teaches them the essential skills needed in every position.

## Roadblocks

The main issue I encountered was my Windows 10 installation getting stuck during updates twice, which left my laptop unusable for a total of over eight hours. Additionally, I was frustrated by internet outages that my ISP couldn’t resolve, citing that the "weather was too hot." Aside from those problems, everything else went well this month.
