When the industrial revolution started productivity was the amount of product a factory worker or machine could make in a day. In our time, productivity is measured by how many items can you check off of your todo list or how many emails can you respond to in a working day.

## The productivity equation

Modern productivity can be explained by a simple equation, this equation counts productivity as work that is actually useful to the individual or company and not the work we do to get out of our actual responsibilities.

The more useful output we can generate in the least amount of time is the amount of productive work that we did in a day.

$$
Productivity = \frac{Useful\;output}{Time\;taken}
$$

If we're working on a task that is boring and we aren't having fun doing it then our productivity will decrease even if we are producing a useful output. If we're doing something that excites us or is fun to do then our productivity increases even if we're doing something that's totally useless.

Taking this same approach to having fun while doing work we can add a fun factor to almost any task that we need to accomplish and it won't be a bother for us since doing that task will be now fun.

Now the equation looks like this.

$$
Productivity = \frac{Useful\;output}{Time\;taken} \times Fun\; factor
$$

By multiplying the amount of useful work done in a day by how fun it was doing it we can see a potentially high increase in the productivity of an individual or team.

## A note on using fancy tools

You can use the most fanciest tools available and even use the most number of apps and services that say that they increase your productivity but if you don't know how to use the app or the app seems to complex then you'll just waste time tinkering with the app or service instead of using it to get actual work done.

> Tools and services don't matter, it's the techniques and systems that matter.

## Summary

Make your tasks and chores fun and you'll complete them easily, build a system around yourself that is designed specifically for you and evolves alongside you.
